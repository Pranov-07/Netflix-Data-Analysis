# Netflix-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes Netflix’s content catalog (2008–2021) to uncover trends in movies and TV shows. The dataset was cleaned and explored using Python to study content growth, popular genres, country-wise distribution, and duration patterns. Visualizations were created to generate insights into Netflix’s content strategy and audience preferences.
